# Node Practice
Repository created to record my practice learning NodeJs with exercises based on the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2) of [Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrewmead/).

## Requirements
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v10.16.3 or above
 - For fourth exercise only
   - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) v4.2.3 or above
   - [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download) to visualize data
   - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to test endopints

## Setup
After cloning the repo, go to the created folder and install the node packages.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasOmar/node-practice.git
cd node-practice
npm run setup-all
```
`setup-all` is the command to install all the projects, but if you want to do it one by one, you can change that last line for one of the following:
| App Setup | Command |
| ------ | ------ |
| All | `npm run setup-all` |
| Notes | `npm run setup-notes` |
| Weather console | `npm run setup-weather-console` |
| Weather web | `npm run setup-weather-web` |
| Task manager | `npm run setup-task-manager` |
| Chat | `npm run setup-chat` |

## How to run it
To use any app, you just have to enter into its folder and run any of the scripts listed on its 'package.json' file. Each command runs with the following structure:
```sh
npm run <command-name>
```
In case you want to run all available commands on a row, execute the following command:
```sh
npm start
```
